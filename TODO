- Determine correct algorithm for memory management: First fit -> segragated -> binary buddies
- Determine correct freeing method: Only set to available -> merge blocks
- Determine metadata management: internal -> external
- Create function to malloc using mmap
- Create calloc using malloc + memset
- Determine a better way to calculate remaining size in split
- Proper realloc should check if there's enough space before reallocation
- Realloc should be able to shift left or right depending on where there's free memory
- Investigate why free_size has such a weird value
